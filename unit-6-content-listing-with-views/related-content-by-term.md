# Related content by term

Site visitors would like to see content related to a specific state/territory. To do this, we need to set up an automatically generated **list of States/Territories in a block** with the following features:

1. When we click on a term such as “ACT” we go to a term listing page that shows all content tagged or categorised with that term.
2. If we then select a specific article such as “Volunteering” we see the full content page.
3. In the sidebar of the “Volunteering” full node page we also see a “related content” block. This will pull in a list of content that’s been tagged or categorised with the same taxonomy term.

In the following exercises we'll make a “list of terms” block and then we'll make the related content block.
