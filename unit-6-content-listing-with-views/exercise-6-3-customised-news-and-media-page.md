# Exercise 6.3: A customised News and Media page

In this exercise we’ll customise the _Employment news_ View page we created earlier, making it show three items of recent content, then a bulleted list of titles of seven recent News and Media articles. Below is what the layout of the page will look like.

1. Locate the View and edit using contextual links
2. Change the number of items to display
3. Add a new display: an attached list
4. Add a header to the attachment
5. Change the offset to exclude the first three articles
6. Change the attachment setting
7. Review your changes

## 3. Add a new display: an attached list

Next we'll add a list of seven more recent articles to the bottom of this view.

1. At the top, click the **+Add** button and select "Attachment".
2.  You’ll now have more than one display available, with the one you’re editing highlighted. Make sure the correct one is always highlighted when you’re editing views.

10. You'll see that Views added a _Title_ field for us. If we needed more fields to be displayed, we could have added them using the **Add** button. Let’s continue with only the Title field for now.

## 5. Change the offset to exclude the first three articles

Our Attachment view will be displayed below the first three News and Media articles, so we need to exclude those from our list to avoid displaying duplicate content:

1. Make sure you're still editing the **Attachment** display. Under the **Pager settings** in the centre column, click "10 items" to change the setting.
2. Change the “Items to display” to 7 and the "Offset" to 3. Apply the changes.
