# Exercise 6.9: Modify an event listing for future dates

There are a variety of ways you could list events. For this exercise, we’ll create a simple view that shows all upcoming events.

## Add sample content

1. Add in 5-10 new events \(either manually or using Devel generate\)
2. Make sure all events are published
3. Include events with both past dates and future dates in the Event Date field

## Modify the view

Go to **Structure** → **Views** and edit the _GovCMS Events Views_ view.

**Customise the display**

**Filter out old events**
