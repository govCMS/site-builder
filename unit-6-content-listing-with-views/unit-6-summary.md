# Unit 6 Summary

This unit gave us an insight into how the Views module works and how you can use it to customise your website. Views is a great way to build complex queries into your database administration. Later in the course we will see other ways to make the most of Views.

#### Always use a caching strategy with Views

You can use caching with Views to save the results of a query for the next site visitor. All views can have a _Tag based_ or _Time based_ cache. If all views are set up with a cache of at least fifteen minutes or more it will reduce the load on the database. _Tag based_ cache is the default configuration and is suitable for most caching scenarios.

**Note:** Very short times in the _Time based_ caching may negatively impact your website performance.

You can change it to a _Time based_ cache in the right-hand column. Choose a setting based on how often your site is updated.\

#### Turn off the Views UI module

When you're not developing Views directly you should disable the UI. This will reduce the load on your serverâ€™s memory, but Views will still work.
