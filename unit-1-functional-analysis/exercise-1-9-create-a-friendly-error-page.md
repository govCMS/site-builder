# Exercise 1.9: Create a friendly error page

Customising error messages is often overlooked, but it’s easy to tailor this experience for your website. See: [https://salsadigital.com.au/somepage](https://salsadigital.com.au/somepage) as an example.

In this exercise you’ll create a custom error message/page. The page could be a graphic, or a useful message.

1. Create **basic pages** with an appropriate message for each situation (e.g. [http://example.com/notfound](http://example.com/notfound) and \[http://example.com/accessdenied]\(http://example.com/accessdenied))
2.  Specify the error page

3. Go to Configuration → System → Basic site settings
4. Type in the paths in the bottom section on **Error pages**
5. Save configuration
