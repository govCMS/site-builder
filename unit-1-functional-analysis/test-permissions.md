# Test permissions

It’s important you use GovCMS’s _User Role_ and _Permissions_ features to help keep your site secure. User roles and permissions help to ensure users can’t take advantage of security vulnerabilities on your site. To test permission settings, follow these steps:

1. Go to _People_  _Permissions_. The permissions under the “Node” section should be as follows:

* **Site Administrator**: All permissions selected
* **Content Author**: Permissions selected for adding and editing any content
* **Content Approver** and **Job Seeker**: Cannot have any permissions to add, edit, edit or delete content. ![](../.gitbook/assets/10.png)
