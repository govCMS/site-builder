# Exercise 1.6: Configure the related links menu block

The last step is to configure the new menu block.

1. Go to _Structure_ → _Block layout_ and find the **Related Links** block. Click **Configure**.
2. Configure the **Title.** We’ll leave it at the default, but this is where you can:

 - Enter a new title
 - Unselect the **Display title** checkbox to remove the block title

3. In the _Visibility settings_ you’ll notice three options:

 - **Pages** - display the block on specific pages
 - **Content Types** – display the block alongside specific content types
 - **Roles** – display the block to specific roles

You’ll often need to alter a block’s _Pages visibility_ settings_._ For this exercise, we want the **Related Links** menu to appear _only_ on the _About us_ page we created earlier, and the _homepage_ of our site.

1. Under **Pages** → **Show for the listed pages**, enter the URL paths of the pages that we want to display the block, e.g. /about-us-0
2. On a new line in the **Pages** _text area_, enter _&lt;front&gt;_. This will ensure your Related Links menu block is displayed on the front \(home\) page of your site.
3. Click Save block.

The **Related Links** menu will only be displayed on the front and About us pages.
