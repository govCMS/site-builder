# Exercise 1.5: Assign the related links menu block to a region

When you create a new menu, GovCMS automatically creates a menu block for the menu. Now we need to assign this menu block with an area on the website.

Go to Structure → Block layout \(/admin/structure/block\)

Find the Postscript 2 area and click the Place block button

Filter the list - Related Links. Select Menus block “Related Links” → Place block

Click Save block

Now check your site to make sure the Related Links menu block is in the Footer

Next, we’ll restrict visibility so it doesn’t show throughout the site
