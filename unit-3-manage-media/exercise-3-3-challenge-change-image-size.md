# Exercise 3.3 (Challenge): Change image size

Remove the _Scale width 1200_ effect in the _Job Posting Image_ style and replace it with Scale and Crop, applying 1200px wide and 400px height dimensions.

Review how GovCMS updates the _Job posting_ images for the existing content.

What if you want to change the image size? The original image is saved as a backup and can be changed. If you decide to change the _Job Posting Image_ style later \(for example change the imageâ€™s dimensions to 200 x 200\) GovCMS will automatically resize all _Job posting_ images. You can also completely change the image style used in a content type by editing the content type display settings. This also flushes the cached versions and creates new, resized versions.
