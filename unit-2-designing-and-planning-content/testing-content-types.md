# Testing content types

## Content test - manual

Create a Job listing manually.

1. Go to _Contnet_ _Add content_ → **Job posting**.
2. On the Add Job posting form, enter the following information:
   * **Job Title** – Police Officers
   * Terms of employment – Permanent
   * Geographical Region: Victoria
   * **Job Description** – Victoria Police is looking for more than 3000 people across the state in their biggest recruitment drive ever. If you’re interested in keeping Victorian communities safe and want a challenging and rewarding career, then join the force.

## Content test – generated content

Often we need content to help test new content types. However, creating content manually can be very time consuming. Instead, we can use the Devel Generate – a module, bundled in GovCMS.

**Note:** The Devel Generate module should not be enabled or used in a production website.

1. Navigate to Extend and search for Devel Generate. Enable the module if not enabled already.

2. Go to Configuration → Development → Generate content
3. Select the Job Posting checkbox
4. Enter 10 in the How many nodes would you like to generate? field
5. Click **Generate** button

> **Note**: Content generated by the Devel Generate module is not published by default – this is due to active content moderation workflow. Make sure you publish content if necessary.
