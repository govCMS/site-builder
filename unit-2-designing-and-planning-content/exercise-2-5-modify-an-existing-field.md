# Exercise 2.5: Modify an existing field

1. Go to Structure → Content types → Job posting → Manage fields
2. Click **edit** on the body field \(this will only change the way the field appears in the Job posting content type, and not others\)

  * Change the **Label** to “Job description”
  * Deselect **Summary** input

3. Click **Save settings**. Your field listing should show the new label.
