# Testing content types

## Exercise 2.8. Create and generate content

In this exercise we will use two methods to create some test content: 1) manual method, 2) automatic content generation

1. **Content test - manual**
2. Go to Add content → Job posting
3. On the Add job posting form, enter the following information:

* **Job Title** – Police Officers
* Terms of employment – Permanent
* Geographical Region: Victoria
* **Job Description** – Victoria Police is looking for more than 3000 people across the state in their biggest recruitment drive ever. If you’re interested in keeping Victorian communities safe and want a challenging and rewarding career, then join the force. ![](../.gitbook/assets/52%20%282%29.png)

1. Leave all remaining default settings
2. Save

You should now see your newly created Job Posting.

1. **Content test – auto generated content**

Often we need content to help test new content types. However, creating content manually can be very time consuming. Instead, we can use the Devel Generate – a module, bundled in GovCMS.

**Note:** The Devel Generate module should not be enabled or used in a production website.

* 1. Navigate to Extend and search for Devel Generate. Enable the module if not enabled already. ![A screenshot of a cell phone

  2. Go to Configuration → Development → Generate content
  3. Select the Job Posting checkbox
  4. Enter 10 in the How many nodes would you like to generate? field
  5. Click **Generate** button

**Note**: Content generated by the Devel Generate module is not published by default – this is due to active content moderation workflow. Make sure you publish content if necessary.
