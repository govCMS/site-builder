# Exercise 2.2: Design a content type in minutes

In this exercise you’ll design your own content type for the Government Jobs Portal \(not a Job Posting content type\).

Sketch the content entry form. Think about what fields you’ll need and what widgets you might need. Sketch how the content would be displayed on the listing page versus a full page.

Sketch how the content might be displayed in two different conditions.

Full page display \(**Full content** _view mode_\)

Listing display \(**Teaser** _view mode_\)
