Since the release of Drupal 7, the Search API module has helped thousands of site builders to add an amazing search experience to their sites. Along with its numerous add-on modules it offers great flexibility and a large range of powerful features – faceting, entity relationships, relevancy configuration, spellchecking, etc. – and its Views integration ensures that all aspects of the site's search page\(s\) can be configured in detail through a well-known interface.
