# Exercise 8.5: Challenge exercises

To experiment with these features, try the following exercises:

* Add a post date to the listing so the jobs can be sorted by date
* Customise the Agency link field to display inline with the label (this may require adding some inline CSS).
* Rearrange the fields like weâ€™ve done in the screenshot below

In this exercise we learned that you can expand the fields available to a view by using relationships. We also saw more about the various display formats available with views.

You also learned how to change the markup output by Views.
