# Exercise 8.3: Configure the job listing

In this exercise we’ll configure the job listing so it filters by terms of employment.

## Edit the job listing \(or create it if you haven’t already\)

If you’ve already created the Job list view, skip to the step

## Configure the view

If you don’t have the job listing view, we’ll create it and set the filter criteria.

1. Go to **Structure** → **Views** → **Add new view**. Configure with these settings:
  - View name: Job listing
  - Show “Content” of type “job posting” sorted by “Newest first”
  - Select the “Create a page” checkbox
  - Keep the defaults for the page setting
  - Select “Create a menu link”
  - Menu: Select “Main navigation” Link text: “Jobs”

2. Click Save and edit

## Configure the view

## Review your changes

Review your changes by checking your homepage. “Jobs” will be part of the main navigation \(because you added it to the menu\) and you’ll now see a dropdown menu that filters the job postings.

## Job list with agency logos \(Views relationships\)

Content types often share information such as taxonomy terms, authors, and so on. We may also want to add in a relationship between content types so that we can share data \(fields\) from one content type with another. When you first set up a view, you select your “base table”. By adding in View relationships, you can share information from tables of other content types.
