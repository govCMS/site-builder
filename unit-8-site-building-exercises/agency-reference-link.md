# Agency reference link

Each government agency offering a job on the site should have its own page with a logo. In addition, each job posting should clearly show which agency is offering the job.

## Important file directory settings

In our next exercise we’ll create a new content type called “Agency”. The content type will include an area to upload the agency’s logo.

When setting up media uploads for content types, consider these two important settings:

1. **File path settings**

    When you add a field for file type, you’ll configure the “file directory”. The file directory settings are hard to change once they’ve been set up, so make sure you consider the settings carefully. The file directory will help you keep track of a file’s location and why they were uploaded.

    Keep your directories organised as you go by adding a file path for each new file field.

2. **Public versus private files**

Go to Configuration → Media → File system

You’ll find the default global directory for file uploads in this area of the admin interface. Files in this area are public, meaning anyone with the link can view/download them. If you’ve got private files you’d like to secure, see this tutorial [http://drupal.org/node/344806.](http://drupal.org/node/344806)

The Agency name is there, and it's a link. We configured it in one of the previous steps.
