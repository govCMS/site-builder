# Agency reference link

Each government agency offering a job on the site should have its own page with a logo. In addition, each job posting should clearly show which agency is offering the job.

#### Important file directory settings:

In our next exercise we’ll create a new content type called “Agency”. The content type will include an area to upload the agency’s logo.

When setting up media uploads for content types, consider these two important settings:

1. **File path settings**

When you add a field for file type, you’ll configure the “file directory”. The file directory settings are hard to change once they’ve been set up, so make sure you consider the settings carefully. The file directory will help you keep track of a file’s location and why they were uploaded.

Keep your directories organised as you go by adding a file path for each new file field.

2. **Public versus private files**

Go to Configuration → Media → File system

You’ll find the default global directory for file uploads in this area of the admin interface. Files in this area are public, meaning anyone with the link can view/download them. If you’ve got private files you’d like to secure, see this tutorial [http://drupal.org/node/344806.](http://drupal.org/node/344806)

#### **Exercise 8.2:** Create Agency References

Content Reference is a useful tool in GovCMS. It helps you create new relationships between content. There are many ways to leverage this connection with Views. For example, when you’re viewing an **agency** page, you could show which jobs “back reference” to that agency.

1. **Create the Agency content type** Using what we’ve covered so far on content types, create a new content type using these settings:

| Name |  Agency |
| :--- | :--- |
| Description |  A government agency listing jobs or services on this site. |
| Title field label |  Agency name |
| Publishing options |  NOT Promoted to front page |
| Display settings |  Don’t Display author and date information. |
| Comment settings |  Closed |
| Menu settings |  No menu |

  
Click Save and add fields

**Note:** Make sure you check permissions, allowing Content Authors to create agencies.

**Add agency logo image field**  
We’re now going to add the image field to the agency content type. When adding the field, make sure you also configure the **form display** and the **display** of the field. Use the following settings:

* **Label:** Agency Logo
* **Field name:** field\_agency\_logo
* **Field type:** Media Reference
* Number of values: 1
* **Required:** Leave unselected
* **Help text:** “If available, please upload a logo for this agency.”
* Media type: Image
* **Form display**: Entity browser. Configure as pictured below: ![](../.gitbook/assets/82%20%282%29.png) When finished, click the **Update** button and then Save the _Manage form display_ page.
* **Display**: rendered entity, rendered as Thumbnail

**Add references field to job posting**Finally, we’re going to add a references field for job postings.

1. Go to Structure → Content types → Job posting and click the Manage fields link.
2. Add a new field using these settings:

* **Type:** Reference → Content
* **Label**: Agency
* **Field name**: agencyref \(click to edit the machine name\)
* Content type: Agency
* **Sort by**: - None -

![](../.gitbook/assets/83%20%281%29.png)

1. Click Save settings
2. You’ll also need to configure the form display. Use the **Select list** _widget_ for the **Agency** field. Note: You can also move the **Agency** field on the form so it’s above the **Job description** field.
3. You’ll also need to configure the display. Set the _Agency_ field to display as a link.
4. Your job posting fields will now look something like the screenshot below. You may rearrange any new fields we’ve added and bring them above the Job description field.![](../.gitbook/assets/84%20%281%29.png)

**Try it out**  
Now that you’ve added the new fields, it’s time to try them out.

The Agency name is there, and it's a link. We configured it in one of the previous steps.
