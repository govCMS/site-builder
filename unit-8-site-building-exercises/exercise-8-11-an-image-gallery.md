With the member list you created a grid-based view of members’ profiles. Now, create a gallery of images from the **News and Media** published on your site.

* If you don’t have **News and Media** articles with images, use the Devel Generate tool to create them.
* Alter the display of the Thumbnails to show up as square images.
* Make a view to display the images in a grid to create a simple gallery.
