# Unit Summary

In this unit, we created **views** of **users** and examined a display setting that creates a content grid. We also looked at how the **Display Suite** module can allow you to change _view modes_ for more control over the page layouts.

We added fields to user profiles and created relationships to share fields and change the output and display.

We learned that some content types in GovCMS use Panelizer page builder, which has a different interface and provides additional flexibility in controlling page layout and regions.
