# Exercise 8.10: Create a custom layout

User profiles currently list all content in one column. In this exercise we’ll re-arrange the profile information into two columns. We’ll change the layout of user profiles using **Display suite**.

1. Review the current layout. Click on a member profile.

2. Go to _Administration_ → _Configuration_ → _People_ → **Account settings** and click **Manage display** tab.

    You’ll see that the _secondary tabs_ are missing and we cannot select a custom _view mode_. Let’s separate our display into a custom view mode **User account**. This separation could allow us to reuse the new _View mode_ later on, if we needed to.

3. Click the **Custom display settings** vertical tab and select to enable the **User account** view mode:

4. Scroll down and click **Save**. After saving your changes, you’ll notice the _secondary tabs_ appear, allowing you to switch to customise the **User account** view mode:

5. Click the **User account** tab.
6. Change the layout to Two columns:

7. After saving your changes, review the **Field** section, you’ll see that it now shows many additional regions, such as:
   - Header \(all existing fields were moved into this region by GovCMS\)
   - Content top
   - Content
   - Sidebar
   - Content bottom
   - Footer
   - Disabled \(this special area shows any fields excluded from display\)

    The **Current layout** thumbnail shows the layout of current view mode
