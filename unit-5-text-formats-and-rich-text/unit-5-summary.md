# Unit 5 Summary

In this unit, we covered how to customise text formats using the **CKEditor module** in GovCMS.

Website security is a serious consideration. After weak passwords, cross-site scripting is the next biggest security risk. By default, GovCMS’s permissions are strict.

This session also showed you how to control what’s displayed on your site and demonstrated how filters control the HTML elements rendered on your site. By allowing trusted users to add iFrames you can include embedded remote content on your site while also protecting your site from malicious codes in &lt;iframes&gt;.
