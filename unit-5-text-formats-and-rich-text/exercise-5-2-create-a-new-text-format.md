# Exercise 5.2 (Challenge): Create a new text format

In this exercise, we want to set up a new text format that allows trusted editors to input iFrames. This will let trusted users embed widgets and videos from popular sites.

Your new text format should have these properties:

* Only available to Content Authors and Site Administrators
* Allow a variety of regular HTML tags
* Allow a video from YouTube
